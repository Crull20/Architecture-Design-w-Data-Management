NoSQL for Movie and Theater Databases
  
Having a NoSQL database for movie and theater databases is helpful for us due to its flexibility and scalability.
They're helpful since our databases deal with diverse and complex data structures that change frequently.The NoSQL
handles flexibility in it's data related to movies (ie., titles, genres, ratings, descriptions, showtimes). as well 
as theater layouts - seating arrangements, accessible compliant areas (ADA), and seat statuses. NoSQL databases 
allow for schema-less data models which make it easier to adapt to new types of data without harmful altercations.
The NoSQL database also helps with scalability in that the movie databases and theater data need to manage high traffic
loads, especially during busy movie times and major hollywood releases. NoSQL databases provide horizontal scalability as well
allowing the data to be distributed across multiple servers fast and efficiently.
